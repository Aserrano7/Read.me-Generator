# Read.me-Generator

## Description
This weeks challenge we had to make a README.md generator. The User would be asked about what they would like for each section of the README.md. These questions were asked using node.js. I was able to provide the question on the console and save those responese to create my README.md template. The hardest part of this challenge was being able to create the template and gather the correct data from the user. After doing some more research I was able to make it work. I learned a lot about the node.js and how as developers we can use it to develop and run our javascript files.
